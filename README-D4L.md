# ðŸŒ‘ Starboard Notebook Plugin for ALP Portal using Iframe 

## **Build Guide (Important)**
Run `yarn`, `yarn run bootstrap` and `yarn run build` in the root of the project.
- Do not perform `yarn` or `yarn build` in the individual starboard packages. 
The dist file located in `packages/starboard-notebook` is then added to `resources` folder in portal to be stored in CDN. 

## **starboard-jupyter**
[starboard-jupyter](https://github.com/gzuidhof/starboard-jupyter) provide Starboard cell support for Jupyter Kernel. It is to be loaded to the `starboard-notebook` stored in the portal and `starboard-jupyter` files will be supported in the portal's CDN.
### Build starboard-jupyter Guide 
Run `yarn` and `yarn build` within the `starboard-jupyter` folder, and upload the build file(dist) into `alp-ui/resources` portal. 

## **Changes in Starboard Files**
1. **Token and Jupyter Cells Management in 'NOTEBOOK_SET_INIT_DATA**

Starboard Cells to initiate the JWT Token and Jupyter Kernel are added to the end of the notebookContent. 
The code added in `NOTEBOOK_SET_INIT_DATA` method located in `core.ts` runs the cells and deletes them. 

2. **Get Runtime Method** 

StarboardNotebookElement's `runtime` property is private. A public getter method: `getRuntime()` has been created. `getRuntime()` is used to register `starboard-jupyter` into the notebook.
